# Windows Artifact Signing

FreeX's current direct-download Windows channel is Velopack, not Inno Setup.
The tester release also publishes a standalone executable and an MSIX. The
Velopack installer, the executable inside it, and the standalone executable
need an Authenticode signature because GitHub distributes them directly.

Microsoft Store submission is different: Partner Center accepts an unsigned
Store package and Microsoft signs it during certification. Do not apply the
Public Trust profile to a Store-bound MSIX. The repository's direct-download
tester MSIX retains its existing certificate path until its manifest identity
and publisher are deliberately migrated.

The Azure resources are:

- tenant: `073e2caa-267e-4a85-8970-e6129ec806a9` (`Freevia.org`)
- subscription: `cdc114ef-0580-49c2-a5e0-9e43d63b9fd0`
- resource group: `rg-signing`
- account: `free-software-signing`
- certificate profile: `freevia-public-signing`
- account URI: `https://eus.codesigning.azure.net/`
- timestamp authority: `http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com`

Signing is an explicit packaging option. Ordinary builds do not contact Azure.
Checksums must be generated after signing.

## One-time local setup

Install Azure CLI, the Artifact Signing client, and a current Windows SDK:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI
winget install -e --id Microsoft.Azure.ArtifactSigningClientTools
```

Then authenticate the user that has **Artifact Signing Certificate Profile
Signer** and select the correct subscription:

```powershell
az login --tenant 073e2caa-267e-4a85-8970-e6129ec806a9
az account set --subscription cdc114ef-0580-49c2-a5e0-9e43d63b9fd0
```

`tools/signing/metadata.json` contains only public resource coordinates, not a
credential. The signing client obtains a short-lived token when it runs.

## Sign an existing executable

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/Invoke-WindowsArtifactSigning.ps1 `
  -Files artifacts/release/FreeX.exe
```

The script signs with SHA-256, adds an RFC 3161 SHA-256 timestamp, and runs
`signtool verify /pa /all`. Use `-VerifyOnly` to validate without submitting a
new signing operation.

## Build signed FreeX direct-download packages

For the standalone tester executable:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/Publish-UserTestBuild.ps1 `
  -Configuration Release -RuntimeIdentifier win-x64 `
  -OutputRoot artifacts/release -Version 0.8.200 `
  -PublishMode SingleFile `
  -ArtifactSigningMetadataPath tools/signing/metadata.json
```

For the Velopack installer, portable archive, and update feed:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/Publish-UserTestBuild.ps1 `
  -Configuration Release -RuntimeIdentifier win-x64 `
  -OutputRoot artifacts/release -Version 0.8.200 `
  -PublishMode Velopack `
  -ArtifactSigningMetadataPath tools/signing/metadata.json
```

Velopack invokes the repository signing wrapper through its native
`--signTemplate` option, so it signs the Windows application payload and
generated installer at the correct packaging stages. The wrapper retries
transient Azure failures and verifies every signed file. Do not
Authenticode-sign ZIP, NUPKG, JSON, SBOM, or checksum files.

## CI with GitHub OIDC

Do not use Antoni Ivanov's interactive identity in CI and do not store a PFX or
client secret. Create a dedicated Entra application or managed identity with a
GitHub federated credential, then grant only that identity **Artifact Signing
Certificate Profile Signer** at the `freevia-public-signing` profile scope.
That Azure setup is intentionally not automated by this repository.

The Windows release job needs `permissions: id-token: write` and `contents:
read`, followed by `azure/login@v3` using `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`,
`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`. Restrict the federated subject
to a protected release environment and the release workflow/ref. Install the
Artifact Signing client on the runner and add
`-ArtifactSigningMetadataPath tools/signing/metadata.json` to the SingleFile and
Velopack commands. Pin third-party actions to reviewed commits.

Enable CI signing only after the workload identity exists, its profile-scoped
role is verified, and a dry run passes Authenticode verification. The current
human signer role does not authorize the GitHub runner.
