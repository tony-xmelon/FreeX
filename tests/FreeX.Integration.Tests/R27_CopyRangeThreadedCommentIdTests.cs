/// Regression test for R27-comments-threaded-deep-1: CopyRangeCommand pasted a threaded comment's
/// root Id and every reply's Id verbatim into the destination cell's thread. Since the destination
/// keeps a fully independent thread (unlike MoveRangeCommand, the source is left untouched), this
/// produced two live threads sharing the same persisted Id/reply Ids. On save,
/// XlsxWorksheetThreadedCommentMapper reuses comment.Id verbatim as the XML "id"/"parentId", so
/// both threads round-tripped with identical ids -- and because reply lookup on reload is keyed
/// globally by parentId string (not scoped per cell), the source's reply got cross-attached to the
/// pasted thread too. The fix clears Id (root + replies) whenever a thread is cloned into a new
/// address (CaptureSourcePayloads), while still preserving Id when a thread is merely
/// snapshotted/restored in place for undo (CaptureCellSnapshots/RestoreCellSnapshot).
